            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more for the pasta water</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
                <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 pound dried spaghetti</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar</li>
                <li>Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, for serving</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Brown the beef. Drain off any excess fat, then, throw in the chopped celery, onion, and garlic and cook until the vegetables soften.</li>

`       <li>Boil and simmer. Dump the rest of the homemade pasta sauce ingredients into the pot and bring the mixture to a boil. Once the spaghetti sauce is boiling, reduce the heat and let it simmer on the stove for 3 hours. 
I know 3 hours sounds like forever, but that’s how long it takes to make a rich, flavorful meat sauce. Just do what the Italians do, (fuhgetaboutit).</li>

        <li>Cook your noodles. Once the homemade spaghetti sauce has had time to simmer, all that’s left to do is boiling the spaghetti noodles according to package instructions and dish it up!</li>
